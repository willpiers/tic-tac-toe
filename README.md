Tic-Tac-Toe
=========

This is a ruby-based command line tic-tac-toe game

Requirements
--
  - The game was built with ruby 2.0.0
  - Should work fine with any version >= 1.9
  - You'll need a command line interface equivalent to terminal on Mac OS X
  
Tests
--
  - Testing is done with rspec

Run all tests with 
```
rspec spec
```

Installation
--
```
git clone https://github.com/willpiers/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
bundle install
```

Play
--
```
ruby play.rb
```
At this point you will be presented with the familiar tic-tac-toe board. You'll choose whether you want to play a friend or the computer, and whether or not you'd like to go first. Then, you'll use the 1-9 keys to make your moves.

#### Have Fun!
